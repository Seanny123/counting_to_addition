Cortical dot products and setting scalar values
Setting label of sub-network didn't cause update
Sub-vocabs not appearing to be applied on certain spa.State
Basal ganglia labels not updating on reload
SPA module outputting scalar balue not recognized as such
Deleting a node that was initially typoed caused an error?
Text for hidden elements got hidden by some other elements

Other bugs:
When something can't be converted into a float in operations.py, a better error
should be thrown
cortical actions still doesn't support fucking scalar multiplication
the associative memory module doesn't have n_neurons_per_ensemble
there should really be a thresholding example with the clipped distribution
